# Sports Analytics
 
Sports analytics are a collection of relevant, historical, statistics that can provide a competitive advantage to a team or individual. Through the collection and analyzation of these data, sports analytics inform players, coaches and other staff in order to facilitate decision making both during and prior to sporting events. 
There are two key aspects of sports analytics â€” on-field and off-field analytics. 

On-field analytics deals with improving the on-field performance of teams and players. It digs deep into aspects such as game tactics and player fitness. Off-field analytics deals with the business side of sports. Off-field analytics focuses on helping a sport organization or body surface patterns and insights through data that would help increase ticket and merchandise sales, improve fan engagement, etc. Off-field analytics essentially uses data to help rightsholders take decisions that would lead to higher growth and increased profitability.I shall be demonstrating some instances of both On-field Analytics and Off-Field Analytics which are used extensively by sports organisations.

The first part is On-Field Anaytics. Initially, I demonstrate the implementation of Pythagorean Expectation which can be used as a tool for match win prediction in Soccer. The Second part is on Off-Field Analytics, in which i demonstrate an instance of Salary Prediction Model (Classification in ML)based on certain evaluative variables and using machine learning models ,gives a prediction of the salary that should be imbursed to a player.


## Lessons Learned


1. Discover which statistics are the best predictors of an NBA playerâ€™s salary.
2. Use a machine learning model to predict NBA salaries.
3. Determine which players have been overvalued/undervalued according to their given predicted salary.
4. Evaluate the dependence of Salary on team performance.
5. Using statistical tools such as Pythagorean expectation.
